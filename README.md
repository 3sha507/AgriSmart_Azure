# 🌾🌱 **AgriSmart – AI-Based Smart Agriculture Assistant** 🤖🚜  

---

# 🌟 **Project Overview**

**AgriSmart** is an AI-powered web application designed to assist farmers in making intelligent agricultural decisions.  

It integrates:

- 🌿 **Machine Learning** for Crop Recommendation  
- 🍃 **Deep Learning (CNN)** for Plant Disease Detection  
- 🌐 **Flask Web Framework** for real-time deployment  

This system enables data-driven farming and early disease detection to improve productivity and reduce crop loss.

# 🎯 **Problem Statement**

Agriculture faces multiple challenges:

- ❌ Traditional crop selection without scientific analysis  
- ❌ Soil nutrient imbalance leading to poor yield  
- ❌ Late identification of plant diseases  
- ❌ Limited access to agricultural experts in rural areas  
- ❌ Manual monitoring that is time-consuming and inefficient  

These issues result in reduced productivity and financial losses.
